## Introduction to Version Control and GitHub

In this section, we introduce the basics of version control and GitHub. These concepts are fundamental to managing and collaborating on code projects.

### **What is Version Control?**

Version control systems (VCS) help track changes to files and manage different versions of those files. They are essential for collaborating on software projects, allowing multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously.

### **Getting Started with Git**

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. Below are some basic Git commands and concepts to get you started:

**Initialize a New Git Repository:**

```bash
# Create a new directory and navigate into it
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init
